"""Community composition analysis: placement mass and tree KR (p=1) distances.

Each sample maps query ids to non-negative read counts.  A query's reads are
spread over *all* candidate placement locations using like_weight_ratio (not
only the best edge, and not collapsed onto the distal tip).  The resulting
measure lives on the fixed reference tree edges; the Kantorovich-Rubinstein
distance (Wasserstein-1, p=1) of two samples is the integral over every edge
of the absolute cumulative-mass difference in the distal subtree along that
edge, summed over edges.
